# this repo contains dumb scripts and reference files

* no_cfg.py: finds system dlls that have CFG disabled (for backward compatability), these dlls can be used for stomping
* ndll_export.csv: function symbols found in ntdll
* export_directory_sorter.py: list and sorts (based on RVA) all exported symbols (helpful for stomping)
